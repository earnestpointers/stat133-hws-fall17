========================

1.  **Was this your first time writing unit tests?**

    Yes
2.  **On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing was the logic of `testthat` tests?**

    Zero. `testthat` is not confusing.
3.  **Was this your first time working with `ggvis`?**

    Yes, and it was not a good experience.
4.  **On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing is the `ggvis` syntax?**

    Six.`ggvis` feels underdeveloped.
5.  **Was this your first time working with conditional panels in `shiny`?**

    Yes, and they're awesome.
6.  **On a scale from 0 to 10, how challenging are conditional panels?**

    Zero. They're not confusing.
7.  **Which of the following graphing paradigms-`base plots`, `ggplot`, `ggvis`- do you like most and why?**

    `ggplot` is fantastic because the layers metaphor is very to use.

    Yes, stackoverflow.
9.  **How much time did you spend on this HW?**

    36 hours.
10. **What was the most time consuming part?**

    Each part required learning something new, which was awesome and took time.
