## Quadratic Equation
In algebra, the quadratic equation is any equation that has the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $x$ represents an unknown and $a, b$ and $c$ represent known numbers such that $a$ is not equal to $0$.
To solve for $x$, use the quadratic formula: $$x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

### Comments and Reflections
The instructions were clear and efficient. This is not my first time using markdown so I cannot tell if the instructions could be better. 

I'm very happy that RStudio renders LaTex in the editor. It is **so** useful.

This assignment took 25 minutes. The most time consuming part was reading the assignment.
